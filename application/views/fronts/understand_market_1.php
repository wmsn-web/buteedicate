                        <p>When it comes to anticipating future moves in the market, humans due to the nature of the economical education, tend to try holding onto something that is considered being correct or in other words - represents something that guarantees success.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-12 mt-3">
                        <p>When it comes to trading this formative thought easily hinders success. People tend to overthink or over analyze when looking for an outcome. Trading is a game of probabilities and risk management. Success therefore heavily relies on correct analysis and psychology. This is why our education aims to teach executing trades whilst having the highest possible winning probabilities and minimizing risk. All fundamental trading executions must be based on the fundamental principles of confluences between higher and lower timeframes.</p><p> Applied correctly, multiple timeframe analysis increases the probability of executing a winning trade enormously. Of course experience in the market and a solid understanding of such are also necessary to minimize the risk of entering a losing position. And if such occurs, one of our educational goals is to provide a skillset and strategies on how to minimize losses whilst positions are still opened.</p>

                        <p>From the examples above and below you can see from annotations, how easy it gets to predict what is going to happen next on the charts by simply mastering price action and market structure - technical analysis.</p><p> Looking at charts on a higher timeframe (the charts above and below are showing Germany40 - for explanation reasons; any stock, indice or fx-pair could have been used) gives us a clear idea of what happened in the market recently - this is colloquial called looking at the big picture.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-12  mt-3">
                        <p>This chart shows the appearance of the 4h chart after placing the 1h chart (coming up next - below) correctly onto the 4h chart. See how each 4h candle is now displayed by four 1h candles - there is more information on the chart.</p><p>Especially as a beginner trader you will benefit from such analysis techniques. While learning the basics, you won’t be able to directly read all the information straight away from a single higher timeframe. This is why a beginner trader is called a beginner trader. Gathering all and only the required information that are needed for executing a winning trade from a higher and multiple timeframes requires experience - this becomes easy when learning from us.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="col-md-12  mt-3">
                        <p>Once we’ve had a look at the bigger picture on a higher timeframe, we start analyzing into the lower timeframes. After identifying trend and sentiment on the 4h chart, the analysis continues on the 1h (and 30min) timeframe.</p><p>With these examples - above and below - you get an impression of what (for instance) the technical analysis, which is part of the educational system, is identifying to predict future market movement. Looking at confluences on different timeframes gives clear indication on upcoming price movements and market structure.

                        <p>Having a closer look - the appearance of the chart after placing the 15min chart directly onto the 1h chart. See how each 1h candle, again is now shown by four 15min candles - one more time, there is more information on the chart.</p>
                        <p>Those are some of the things that our educational system covers in great detail. Generally technical analysis is a skill that is learnable. Fundamental understanding of price behavior at different market times is vital for success being a trader. What our education offers our students is not a shortcut to success but among others a professional guidance to becoming a profitable trader. Once you decide to join - we will provide you the skills which are necessary to master the art of trading. We will teach you how to trade - leaving out the b******it.</p>
                        <p>Be prepared to work hard when learning and applying - everything seems very easy when talking about break & retest, fakeouts, impulsive and correction moves after price has already moved, but it is a different thing to spot it correctly while it’s actually happening. Therefore experience and a simple, reliable skill set based on fundamentals is needed.</p>
                        <p>One main focus is to teach this to you - reading and understanding the market - and how to read candles. Multiple timeframe confluence eliminates most of the noise in the market; this is very helpful - especially as a beginner trader. We aim to teach you to grab as many confirmations as possible while being in the market; confirmation on multiple timeframes and higher timeframe confirmations before executing any trade.</p>
                        <p>After mastering this skill you’ll see how easy it becomes to predict upcoming price action in the market.</p>

                        <h2>Volume & News Trading</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-12 mt-5">
                        <p>Trading news is a huge thing right now; some try to call it volume trading. Whenever there is important data to be published, retail traders look for an opportunity to take a risk into making some sort of money, which is necessarily not a bad thing, but regarding the progress of becoming a consistent profitable trader - it’s not a good thing either. These high news events like interest rates, CPI, jobless claims and so on, they all happen with a very high volume and bring volatility into the market. This makes it unnecessarily hard to »predict or anticipate« how price will move.</p>
                        <p>
                            If you want to trade the volatility happening with the news, you will try to do that by placing a market order. After placing your order and counting down into the event, tension will rise straining you up wanting to either close the position in profit or near your stop loss if price comes closer to it. Once the news is released volume pumps into the market and all of the sudden you see that your position is gone (in case of setting a hard stop loss). You will look up your stats and notice that your stop loss got slipped by xx-amount of points. You become rageous and blame the broker for setting you up, messing you up. Well, what actually happened is explainable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The prices shown on the charts are being given to the broker by the market and presented to you as they happen. Let’s imagine you had an open buy position at 12.100 and your SL was set at 12.080. When the news was released, the volume and volatility moved the price so fast that the low, which the broker received from the market at the release, was 12.070.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Technically it wasn’t possible for the broker to execute at your stop loss. Your position was closed at the next best price.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Same thing with pending orders. Imagine having an order pending at 12.150. As the news is released, price gets pushed so fast that the next price your broker receives is 12.175; 25 points above your initial buy order. Volatility during news releases often comes with such a high volume that brokers cannot even execute the orders at the price that is set by the trader. Instead they get activated at the next best price that is being received. And then also you might have to account for temporary wider spreads, too.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the end of the story, make sure to set stop losses in profit (correctly) when going into data releases with any open positions or do not trade news, especially as a beginner. Taking unnecessary risks and not following the trading plan makes no sense at all. At Byteducate we make sure no one takes unnecessary risks or does stupid things with the news.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Following the trading plan and focusing on a high winning rate, professional risk management and developing a disciplined trading character is the path to success in the financial markets.
