                        <p>Byteducate isn’t just an education platform. Applying everything correctly will transform your life - through becoming part of the community you'll get feedback & be consistently supported. Therefore our community support is one of the best you will find anywhere. Let’s have a closer look at how the community works.</p>
                        <p>
                            All educational content provided is created by ourselves. Our intern seminars are hosted at least once or twice a week. Those are recorded and uploaded for reviewing later. As a member you will have access even though you did not take part in the actual event.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Seminars are either scheduled a few weeks ahead or in case of spontaneous decision to hold a seminar - announcements are made 1-2 days in advance in the respective chatroom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During and after every seminar, everyone is encouraged to write questions or any issues down they had during the days before. We will go over them.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>When it comes to professional coaching - we take this approach very seriously.</b></p>
                        <p>
                            Of course there will always be seminars that are open for non - members. These will be advertised as such. As a member your participation at those will largely be free of charge. In person seminars are excluded from this - as a member you’ll get a fair discount for any in person seminar.
                        </p>

                                Sometimes when announcements are made in groups, they either get lost or are ignored by a few. For example, imagine - there was an announcement made for a spontaneous online seminar. Sometimes there will be so many following messages that the important message will be lost in the flood of other comments. So we decided to keep this separated.
